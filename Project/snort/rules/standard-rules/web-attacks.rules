# These signatures are going away.  They were based on generic signatures that
# would catch common commands issued to exploit form variable vulnerabilities, 
# but it is so trivial to evade these that it gives the user a false sense of
# security.
#
# plus, many of them were wrong.   uricontent:"ps%20" for example, since
# http_inspect takes care of decoding for us, that should really look like 
# "ps ".
