# Building-Networked-Systems-Security-EP2520

This is a project-/implementation-/lab- based course that enhances and extends the understanding of modern networked systems security. It builds on the preparation of students through the Networked Systems Security course (EP2500). It seeks to hone the ability to deal with open-ended, real-world engineering problems, as well as prepare for independent work on related topics.

The course hones students understanding of concepts and technologies and common security requirements across various systems. It elaborates how features of each system determine the state-of-the-art of security solutions and how design decisions should be made for effective and efficient security solutions. This project-oriented course gives students the opportunity to deal with real-world problems and gain strong insights on implementation; it prepares them for further work in the industry, towards an MSc thesis, and possibly later Licentiate/PhD work, on any topic related to network and system security.

The course trains students to handle contemporary security problems for networked systems. Through problem-based learning and team-work, students tackle modern technical challenges for cybersecurity. Students investigate requirements, design specifications, prepare solutions with professional tools and critically assess the efficiency of alternative solutions.

### Intended learning outcomes
After passing the course, the student should be able to

* implement networked systems security solutions with specific security requirements and system constraints 
* implement, analyse and evaluate security mechanisms with regard to the level on the security they provide and the overhead costs for the system
in order to polish the ability to handle open issues and real engineering problems and prepare for a degree project in related subjects.
